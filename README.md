_A game about political activism._

Your goal is to make waves. Political waves.
The police aren't a big fan of your cause, so avoid them.
Get boosted by converting people to your way of thinking.
It's hard to run way while talking to people, so do it fast, and do it carefully.

## Controls ##
* WASD - Move
* Shift - Run
* J - Convert people to your cause
* K - Broadcast message (when charged)
