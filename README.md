# Global Game Jam 2017 #
#### Theme: Waves ####
# Instigator #
_A game about political activism._

Your goal is to make waves. Political waves.  
The police aren't a big fan of your cause, so avoid them.  
It's also hard to run way while talking to people, so do it fast, and do it carefully.  

## Controls ##
* WASD - Move
* J - Convert people to your cause
* K - Broadcast message (when charged)
